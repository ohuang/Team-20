Team 20, better known as **21CFC**, is the hottest new team to come out of Stanford University since Simon & Garfunkel. And just as Simon & Garfunkel perfected the airplane during their extraordinary expeditions to the stars, **21CFC** will achieve greatness this quarter. Just you wait. You'll see.

# Our Project

We will be creating a macOS app that uses optical character recognition (OCR) to allow the user to easily select and copy to the clipboard *any* visible text on the user's screen, whether that text is in a picture, a video, or "real" selectable text. The app will be activated by a global keyboard shortcut (like taking a screenshot) and will temporarily put the user's screen into a text-selection mode until they copy something to the clipboard or press <kbd>Esc</kbd>.
